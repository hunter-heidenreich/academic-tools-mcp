# Changelog

All notable changes to **academic-tools-mcp** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses **calendar versioning**: each release is named for the day
it was cut — `YYYY.MM.DD`, tagged `vYYYY.MM.DD` in git. The PEP 440 form in
`pyproject.toml` drops leading zeros (tag `v2026.05.29` ↔ version `2026.5.29`).
A rare second release on the same day takes a `.postN` suffix.

Entries dated before `2026.05.29` are **reconstructed from git history** — the
project carried no tags until then, so each date marks the day that batch of work
landed on `main`, grouped by milestone rather than per commit.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [2026.05.29] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- `download_pdf(force_refresh=True)` no longer deletes the cached PDF *before*
  attempting the re-download. A failed refetch (404, transport error,
  `MAX_PDF_BYTES` abort) now leaves the existing file intact; the new bytes are
  streamed to a temp file and atomically swapped in only on success. Affects all
  three PDF providers (arXiv, bioRxiv/medRxiv, ACL Anthology). ([#6])

## [2026.04.30] — 2026-04-30

### Added

- `search_cached_papers` — BM25 keyword search across all locally converted
  paper markdown.
- `find_in_paper` — substring / whole-word search inside a single converted
  paper, returning the section and character offset of every hit so an agent can
  chain straight into `get_paper_section`.
- `get_papers_metadata` — batch metadata that collapses N identifiers into
  ⌈N/50⌉ OpenAlex calls (`/works?filter=doi:…|…`) plus concurrent arXiv/bioRxiv
  fan-out, for reference-graph enrichment.
- Streaming PDF downloads: chunked write (64 KiB) to a sibling temp file with
  atomic rename, plus a `MAX_PDF_BYTES` cap (default 200 MB) that aborts oversize
  streams mid-download.

### Changed

- Replaced the single global serial request lock with **per-provider
  concurrency caps**, so reference-graph traversals run in parallel up to each
  provider's limit instead of fully serialising.
- Robustness audit across all seven API clients: pooled `httpx.AsyncClient`,
  one transparent retry honouring `Retry-After`, request single-flight, negative
  caching, positive-cache TTL eviction, and per-provider stats counters.
- Split the dense CLAUDE.md guidance into path-scoped `.claude/rules/` files.

## [2026.04.22] — 2026-04-22

### Changed

- Consolidated the per-provider metadata tools into one identifier-dispatched
  family (`get_paper_metadata` / `_authors` / `_abstract` / `_bibtex`).
- Unified the reference/citation tools (6 → 4) with count-as-survey across
  Crossref and OpenCitations.
- Paginated `get_paper_authors` to bound responses on large-collaboration
  papers; replaced `get_paper_section` truncation with offset pagination.
- Normalised HTTP errors across all seven API clients; tightened tool
  docstrings; slimmed search hits to triage-only fields; stripped cache
  filesystem paths from PDF pipeline tool responses.

### Removed

- Trimmed the exposed tool surface: disabled topics/citations by default,
  removed arbitrary-URL download, merged redundant author/import tools, and
  dropped the Wikipedia existence check.

### Fixed

- `convert_pdf` no longer re-runs conversion when the sections cache is merely
  stale; a missing section-cache checksum is now treated as stale; subprocess
  failure paths are hardened.

## [2026.04.16] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- Server instructions, section truncation, and `anthropic/maxResultSizeChars`
  annotations on tool responses. ([#2])
- Response-quality improvements: error `suggestion` fields, pre-computed
  aggregates, empty-state handling, and retry hints. ([#4])
- Non-retryable signalling for PDF conversion failures. ([#5])

### Changed

- Consolidated 15 PDF-pipeline tools into 4 unified tools. ([#3])

### Fixed

- Duplicated "to markdown" phrasing in the convert tool docstrings. ([#1])

## [2026.04.05] — 2026-04-05

### Added

- Initial public release. A FastMCP server wrapping OpenAlex, arXiv,
  bioRxiv/medRxiv, Crossref, OpenCitations, ACL Anthology, and Wikipedia.
- Paper metadata / authors / abstract / BibTeX tools; reference and citation
  graph tools; the PDF download → markdown conversion → section-reading
  pipeline; manual PDF/markdown import.
- Configurable external PDF converter, env-based API configuration
  (mailto / keys), MIT license, and a public-facing README.
